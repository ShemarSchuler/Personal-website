    <h2> Start of my basketball career</h2>
    <h4> 
      Since I was young I always played basketball and that's something that carried with me through highschool. I've always had a passion for basketball. I would spend countless hours on the court practicing on dribbling, shooting, and defense. By the time I was in middle school my skills were beginning to show as I led my team in many games. My early experience on the court not only honed my skills but also instilled me with a love for teamwork and competition that would shape my future.</h4>
